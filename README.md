# Improvements
These are some improvements that I want to add if we have more time: 
- In the first screen, users can add and delete options. We can add a new feature for users to edit options. 
- Everytime users click the spin button, the app use CABasicAnimation with random numbers to rotate the wheel. Another way is to let users hold the button
or spin the wheel with their fingers, so we can calculate the velocity of the wheel. 
- Currently, the app uses MVC. For scalability, we can change to another Architexture (MVVM). 
- Add Unit Tests.
